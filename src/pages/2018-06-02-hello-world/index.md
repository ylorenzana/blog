Yo! This wouldn't be much of a blog without at least one blog post, so, here is my first blog post—a cliché Hello World post, of course!

### So, what is this blog about, you might ask yourself?

Truth is, I don't have a very specific answer yet! The least I can say at the moment is that I'll be talking about anything and everything related to JavaScript and web development. I have specific posts in mind related to some side projects I'm working on, so I'll be posting those in the coming weeks.

I've been thinking about starting a blog since I was a sophomore in college, but I never got myself to start, until in late 2017 I heard about [Gatsby.js](https://gatsby.org) and found out how simple it made the process—plus, I would get to work with React at the same time, so thats a definite win! Now that I finally launched my blog, I can share all the stuff I learn while working on projects. You know what they say, no better way of solidifying what you learn than explaining it to someone else.
