This wouldn't be much of a blog without at least one blog post, so, here is my first blog post—a cliché _Hello World_ post, of course!

### So, what is this blog about, you might ask yourself?

Truth is, I don't have a very specific answer yet! The least I can say at the moment is that I'll be talking about anything and everything related to JavaScript and web development. I have specific posts in mind related to some side projects I'm working on, so I'll be posting those in the coming weeks.

I've been thinking about starting a blog since I was a sophomore in college, but I never got myself to start, not until in late 2017 I heard about [Gatsby.js](https://gatsby.org) and found out how simple it made the process. Plus, I would get to work with React at the same time, so thats a definite win! Now that I finally launched my blog, I can share all the stuff I learn while working on projects. You know what they say, no better way of solidifying what you learn than explaining it to someone else. Stay tuned!

If you would like to ask me any questions, or simply say hi, you can follow me on Twitter [@yanglorenzana](https://www.twitter.com/yanglorenzana), or send me an email at ylorenzana95@gmail.com.
