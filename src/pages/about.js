        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
          Yo! I'm Yang Lorenzana. I'm a software developer who loves all things
          JavaScript. I recently graduated from Mercyhurst University with a
          degree in Information Technology. I got into the world of programming
          and CS at an early age, but I'll elaborate on that in a blog post
          someday.
        </p>
        <h2>About my work</h2>
        <p>
          I have prior experience working with a lot of dev "stuff", but the
          most relevant ones to my work today are Node.js, Express.js, Hapi.js,
          MongoDB, MySQL, Firebase, React, and Angular. I also work with Python
          at times. I learned all of the fundamental Computer Science and
          object-oriented programming concepts using Python, because it was the
          language chosen by my school's CIS department. Here's a download link
          for my&nbsp;

          <a href="https://github.com/ylorenzana">GitHub</a>&nbsp;profile in
          case you're curious in viewing some of my workâ€”I pinned the repos of
          some of the relevant projects I have worked on to the front page.
        </p>
        <p>
          I used to prefer back-end development, but the more I work with React,
          the more I have grown to enjoy writing code for the front-end. I am
          currently working on some small React projects, and I'm going to be
          blogging throughout the process, so stay tuned!
