        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
          Yo! I'm Yang Lorenzana. I'm a software developer who loves all things
          JavaScript. I recently graduated from Mercyhurst University with a
          degree in Information Technology. I got into the world of programming
          and CS at an early age, but I'll elaborate on that in a blog post
          someday.
        </p>
        <h2>About my work</h2>
        <p>
          I have prior experience working with a lot of dev "stuff", but the
          most relevant ones to my work today are Node.js, Express.js, Hapi.js,
          MongoDB, MySQL, Firebase, React, and Angular. I also work with Python
          at times. I learned all of the fundamental Computer Science concepts
          using Python, because it was the language chosen by my school's CIS
          department. Here's a download link for my&nbsp;

            <strong>GitHub</strong>
          </a>&nbsp;profile in case you're curious in viewing some of my workâ€”I
          pinned the repos of some of the relevant projects I have worked on to
          the front page.
          <p>
            I used to prefer back-end development, but the more I work with
            React, the more I have grown to enjoy writing code for the
            front-end. I am currently working on some small React projects, and
            I'm going to be blogging throughout the process, so stay tuned!
